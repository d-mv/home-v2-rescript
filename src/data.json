From the beginning the decision was made not to use templates and work out something different. The result - you are looking at it. The initial mockup was done in Sketch, the working mockup in HTML/CSS. As main tool I used Vue.js (+ Vuex) with SCSS. To simplify dev process, the project is using JSON file with all the data and links to images on Cloudinary. Favicon designed  in Affinity Designer, while the pack with manifest.json done with Image2icon app. Later if has been reworked from ground in React. Styled Components instead of SCSS and React Icons instead of Font Awesome. TypeScript, auto Dark Mode on macOS.",
